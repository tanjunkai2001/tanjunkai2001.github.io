<!-- ## 👨‍💼 About Me | 个人简介 -->
I’m a second-year graduate student from [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest include *robotics control*, *intelligent control*, *learning-based control*, and *unmanned system control*.
<!-- - 🌐 Personal Website: [tanjunkai2001.github.io](https://tanjunkai2001.github.io) -->

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hui Cao](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/huicao) and [Prof. Shuangsi Xue](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/xssxjtu) of BIR Lab, Xi'an Jiaotong University. I am also a student of the [Industrial Automation Lab](https://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/szdw/bssds/gyzdhjys.htm).



## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests include:
- Data-Driven Unmanned Systems Optimal Control (数据驱动的无人系统最优控制, *IEEE TASE*, *INS*, *NoDy*)
- Human-Machine Hybrid Enhanced Control (人机混合增强控制, *Neurocomputing*, *IJRNC*)

## 💻 Core Competencies
- **Theoretical Research**: Solid foundation in advanced control and reinforcement learning theory. Leading research on human-machine hybrid control with publications in top journals including IEEE TASE, Information Sciences, and Nonlinear Dynamics.
- **Engineering Practice**: Extensive experience with unmanned systems development, including UAV-UGV collaborative control projects and multi-unmanned system hardware platforms based on optical motion capture systems.
