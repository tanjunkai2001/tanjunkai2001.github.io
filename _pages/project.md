* [https://github.com/tanjunkai2001/FxT-CL-ACI](https://github.com/tanjunkai2001/FxT-CL-ACI))

This ongoing research focuses on developing advanced control methodologies for unmanned systems:

* Developed Stackelberg game-based reinforcement learning framework for robust optimal control
* Implemented prescribed performance constraints for efficient tracking control in nonlinear systems
* Created novel game-theoretic optimization method for high-dimensional nonlinear systems
* Published 3 first-author papers in ***IEEE TASE***, ***Nonlinear Dynamics***, ***INS*** and presented at ASCC, ICARM, ICDL

The project aims to enhance the reliability and performance of autonomous systems by integrating game theory with reinforcement learning to achieve robust control under challenging conditions.

**Tools:** Optimal Control, Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, MATLAB, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/tanjunkai2001/human-machine-safe](https://github.com/tanjunkai2001/human-machine-safe) (2025 ***IJRNC***)

In this research project, I focused on developing advanced methodologies for enhancing human-machine collaboration in complex systems:

* Developed safety-guarding reinforcement learning methods for optimal shared control in pilot-UAV interactive systems
* Implemented Nash equilibrium game and level-k rationality model to enhance human-machine collaboration stability
* Created data-driven interaction modeling approach to optimize human-machine cooperative strategies
* Published 3 first-author journal papers in ***Neurocomputing***, ***IJRNC***, ***JAI*** and obtained 3 national patents

This work addresses critical challenges in human-machine teaming by establishing novel frameworks that balance human decision-making capabilities with machine precision for optimal shared performance.
