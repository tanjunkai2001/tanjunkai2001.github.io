  abstract = {Cooperation between humans and autonomy is a critical topic of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control. How to co-pilot the UAV with human operator to achieve optimal performance presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven optimal shared control method for UAV using the Koopman operators to predict the nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs. An original shared control mechanism is established to allocate the relationship between optimal and human control inputs. The model of the system is learned from human maneuver data via the Koopman operator approach, and the optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. The Lyapunov theory analyzes the stability of the proposed method. Compared with offline RL methods, the proposed method can learn the optimal controller online without a precise UAV dynamics model from human maneuver data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical and Human-in-the-loop (HiTL) simulation.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a finite-time safe reinforcement learning control algorithm for multi-player nonzero-sum games (FT-SRL-NZS). In addressing the issue of finite-time safe optimal control, value functions incorporating designated barrier functions for the involved players are established within the transformed finite-time stable space. The finite-time safe optimal controller is derived from the solution to the transformed Nash equilibrium condition. An actor-critic structure is proposed for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the finite-time stable space, aimed at approximating the finite-time value function and optimal controller using a novel finite-time concurrent learning update law. A dynamic event-trigger rule is utilized to adjust the trigger condition in real-time, thereby minimizing the computational and communicative demands associated with calculating Nash equilibrium. Lyapunov stability analysis is employed to examine the finite-time equilibrium of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hardware experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed FT-SRL-NZS algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an optimized shared control algorithm for human--AI interaction, implemented through a digital twin framework where the physical system and human operator act as the real agent while an AIdriven digital system functions as the virtual agent. In this digital twin architecture, the real agent acquires an optimal control strategy through observed actions, while the AI virtual agent mirrors the real agent to establish a digital replica system and corresponding control policy. Both the real and virtual optimal controllers are approximated using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Specifically, critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to learn the virtual and real optimal value functions, while actor NNs are trained to derive their respective optimal controllers. A novel shared mechanism is introduced to integrate both virtual and real value functions into a unified learning framework, yielding an optimal shared controller. This controller adaptively adjusts the confidence ratio between virtual and real agents, enhancing the system's efficiency and flexibility in handling complex control tasks. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed AI--human interactive system is validated through two numerical examples: a representative nonlinear system and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the shared control of bounded rational human behavior with cooperative autonomous machines. For the collaboration of humans and machines, it is crucial to ensure the safety of the interactive process due to the involvement of human beings. First, a barrier-function-based state transformation is developed to ensure full state safety constraints. A level-k thinking framework is exploited to obtain bounded rationality. Every single level-k control policy is approximated by using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Inspired by the theory of human behavior modeling, a probabilistic distribution based on Softmax is utilized to model human behavior, which imitates the uncertainty of human intelligence in the cooperative game. Through the construction of a shared control framework, the control inputs of humans and machines are blended to achieve stabilization safely and efficiently. Finally, simulations are implemented to test the effectiveness of the proposed cooperation architecture. The result demonstrates that full-state asymmetric constraints and stabilization are guaranteed in commonly safety-critical situations, and the shared control framework ensures the safety of the overall system when one of the participants is not safety-aware.},

  abstract = {Real-world applications of nonlinear systems tracking control are always challenging due to the existence of uncertainties and disturbances. To design a robust optimal tracking controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with disturbances and actuator saturation, this paper investigates the prescribed performance robust optimal tracking control problem. A prescribed performance mechanism is constructed to convert the dynamics of tracking error into transformed error dynamics, which keeps the system's operating states within specific bounds, ensuring tracking with predefined error constraints. For the optimal tracking controller design, an optimal index is established to optimize the performance of tracking control, and a robust optimal index is established to optimize the disturbance effect on the tracking error. To achieve robust optimal tracking control that minimizes both optimal and robust optimal indexes, a Stackelberg game is constructed, which provides a hierarchical game structure for the optimal controller and the worst disturbance. The robust optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. An actor-critic-identifier algorithm is designed to approximate the optimal value function, optimal controller, and drifted system parameters. Lyapunov theory is utilized to analyze the closed-loop system's stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimal control method, two numerical simulations and a hardware experiment on a quadcopter system are conducted. The experiment results demonstrate that our method successfully achieves prescribed performance tracking control when actuators are saturated and disturbances are present.},
