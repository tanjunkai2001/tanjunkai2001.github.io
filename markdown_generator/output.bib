  abstract = {In this paper, a hierarchical safe reinforcement learning control framework is developed to achieve safe tracking control of the quadcopter by learning from the demonstration of human pilots. This hierarchical framework contains two levels. First, the higher level includes a motion planner which learns from the collected data of pilot maneuvers. Then, the low-level controller tracks the high-level replanned motion and avoids obstacles, which provides a safe guarantee for the quadcopter. The human pilot's intention is inferred with the technique of dynamic movement primitives, which learns from the pilot-maneuvered trajectory and replans a similar but more efficient trajectory. Safe reinforcement learning is implemented at the low level to track the replanned trajectory and avoid obstacles. The stability of the tracking control is analyzed using the Lyapunov function. Two hardware experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical safe reinforcement learning framework for the safe tracking control of the quadcopter.},

  abstract = {Optimizing the cooperative interaction between expert operators (experienced humans) and autonomous controllers is essential for maximizing performance in complex cyber-physical systems (CPS). While both human expertise and autonomous robotics offer unique advantages, effectively integrating their complementary capabilities remains challenging, particularly under uncertainties and input constraints. This paper investigates the composite learning-based fixedtime optimized shared prescribed-performance control (CL-FxT-OSPPC) in the context of human-robotics cooperative game (HRCG). A smooth shared mechanism within the framework of nonzero-sum game is constructed to balance the effects and trade-offs between the humanoperator and autonomous controller. Prescribed performance tracking with bounded error trajectories is achieved through performance transformation and input cost functions. Fixed-time composite learning is proposed for the approximation of optimal shared controllers within fixedtime, in which the experience relay of the human-operator and autonomous controller is blended and integrated adaptively. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to ensure fixed-time convergence of the shared controller. Extensive simulation results on dubin car and UAV control demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed structure.},

How to co-pilot the UAV with human operator to achieve optimal performance presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven optimal shared control method for UAV using the Koopman operators to predict the nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs. An original shared control mechanism is established to allocate the relationship between optimal and human control inputs. The model of the system is learned from human maneuver data via the Koopman operator approach, and the optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. The Lyapunov theory analyzes the stability of the proposed method. Compared with offline RL methods, the proposed method can learn the optimal controller online without a precise UAV dynamics model from human maneuver data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical and Human-in-the-loop (HiTL) simulation.},

  abstract = {To deal with the problem of interconnected leaderfollower cooperation in complex environments, a hierarchical safe reinforcement learning with prescribed performance control (HSRL-PPC) scheme is proposed in this paper. The HSRLPPC scheme contains two levels: a higher-level with a leader agent and a lower-level with a follower agent. For higher level, the leader is responsible for detecting and avoiding moving environmental obstacles by planning an optimal path. At the lower-level, the follower is required to track the leader within prescribed performance bounds. To obtain the optimal control inputs to the leader and follower agents, the problem of optimal prescribed performance safe control is formulated and solved by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Due to the nonlinearity of system dynamics and the complexity of moving obstacles, the optimal value functions are usually hard to obtain in practice. To address this issue, the leader's optimal value function is approximated using a state-following critic neural network, which extrapolates the training data to neighboring states, and the follower's optimal value function is approximated by a regular critic neural network. The Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed HSRL-PPC scheme is verified by two simulation examples and a hardware experiment with a quadcopter-vehicle interconnected system.},

In this digital twin architecture, the real agent acquires an optimal control strategy through observed actions, while the AI virtual agent mirrors the real agent to establish a digital replica system and corresponding control policy. Both the real and virtual optimal controllers are approximated using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Specifically, critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to learn the virtual and real optimal value functions, while actor NNs are trained to derive their respective optimal controllers. A novel shared mechanism is introduced to integrate both virtual and real value functions into a unified learning framework, yielding an optimal shared controller. This controller adaptively adjusts the confidence ratio between virtual and real agents, enhancing the system's efficiency and flexibility in handling complex control tasks.

First, a barrier-function-based state transformation is developed to ensure full state safety constraints. A level-k thinking framework is exploited to obtain bounded rationality. Every single level-k control policy is approximated by using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Inspired by the theory of human behavior modeling, a probabilistic distribution based on Softmax is utilized to model human behavior, which imitates the uncertainty of human intelligence in the cooperative game.

Finally, simulations are implemented to test the effectiveness of the proposed cooperation architecture. The result demonstrates that full-state asymmetric constraints and stabilization are guaranteed in commonly safety-critical situations, and the shared control framework ensures the safety of the overall system when one of the participants is not safety-aware.},

To design a robust optimal tracking controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with disturbances and actuator saturation, this paper investigates the prescribed performance robust optimal tracking control problem. A prescribed performance mechanism is constructed to convert the dynamics of tracking error into transformed error dynamics, which keeps the system's operating states within specific bounds, ensuring tracking with predefined error constraints. For the optimal tracking controller design, an optimal index is established to optimize the performance of tracking control, and a robust optimal index is established to optimize the disturbance effect on the tracking error.

  abstract = {This study proposes an integrated control framework that combines prescribed performance backstepping with reinforcement learning (RL) optimization for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) operating under disturbances. The key innovation lies in enforcing guaranteed transient and steady-state tracking performance while achieving optimal control behavior through online learning. A systematic two-stage control architecture is developed: An outer-loop position controller incorporating prescribed performance bounds handles the underactuated dynamics, complemented by an inner-loop attitude controller ensuring desired orientation tracking. The inner-loop controller employ critic-actor neural networks to approximate optimal solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, while the outer-loop controller optimizes position tracking performance through Hamilton-JacobiIsaacs (HJI) equation solutions. Rigorous stability analysis establishes asymptotic convergence using Lyapunov theory under the prescribed performance constraints. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations, demonstrating exceptional tracking precision with position errors under prescribed performance.},
