  abstract = {Cooperation between humans and autonomy is a critical topic of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control. How to co-pilot the UAV with human operator to achieve optimal performance presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven optimal shared control method for UAV using the Koopman operators to predict the nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs. An original shared control mechanism is established to allocate the relationship between optimal and human control inputs. The model of the system is learned from human maneuver data via the Koopman operator approach, and the optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. The Lyapunov theory analyzes the stability of the proposed method. Compared with offline RL methods, the proposed method can learn the optimal controller online without a precise UAV dynamics model from human maneuver data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical and Human-in-the-loop (HiTL) simulation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an optimized shared control algorithm for human–AI interaction, implemented through a digital twin framework where the physical system and human operator act as the real agent while an AIdriven digital system functions as the virtual agent. In this digital twin architecture, the real agent acquires an optimal control strategy through observed actions, while the AI virtual agent mirrors the real agent to establish a digital replica system and corresponding control policy. Both the real and virtual optimal controllers are approximated using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Specifically, critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to learn the virtual and real optimal value functions, while actor NNs are trained to derive their respective optimal controllers. A novel shared mechanism is introduced to integrate both virtual and real value functions into a unified learning framework, yielding an optimal shared controller. This controller adaptively adjusts the confidence ratio between virtual and real agents, enhancing the system’s efficiency and flexibility in handling complex control tasks. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed AI–human interactive system is validated through two numerical examples: a representative nonlinear system and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             This article considers the shared control of bounded rational human behavior with cooperative autonomous machines. For the collaboration of humans and machines, it is crucial to ensure the safety of the interactive process due to the involvement of human beings. First, a barrier‐function‐based state transformation is developed to ensure full state safety constraints. A level‐ thinking framework is exploited to obtain bounded rationality. Every single level‐ control policy is approximated by using adaptive dynamic programming. Inspired by the theory of human behavior modeling, a probabilistic distribution based on Softmax is utilized to model human behavior, which imitates the uncertainty of human intelligence in the cooperative game. Through the construction of a shared control framework, the control inputs of humans and machines are blended to achieve stabilization safely and efficiently. Finally, simulations are implemented to test the effectiveness of the proposed cooperation architecture. The result demonstrates that full‐state asymmetric constraints and stabilization are guaranteed in commonly safety‐critical situations, and the shared control framework ensures the safety of the overall system when one of the participants is not safety‐aware.},

  abstract = {随着工业系统规模的增大以及人工智能技术特别是机器学习的发展，大规模复杂系统的控制方法在多个领域得到应用。作为复杂系统中的基础问题，互联系统稳定控制以及智能体博弈纳什均衡往往具有很强的耦合性以及非线性，也一直是多智能体领域的研究热点。大规模系统通常是重点安全控制系统，需要通过一定的优化约束条件来满足系统的安全运行要求。为了保障系统运行的安全稳定，可以在系统的控制层面加入安全保障机制。安全保障控制器就是一种在原有的系统层级控制策略架构上拓展的决策机制，通过对系统危险倾向进行反向补偿，实现整体状态的安全稳定运行，因此安全保障控制器的研究对重点安全的大规模系统稳定安全具有很高的研究价值。 本文主要设计了一种针对包括互联系统、非零和博弈在内的复杂系统的安全保障控制器，不仅能够满足凸集合的安全边界约束要求，还可以满足传统安全控制器无法满足的非凸集合安全约束要求。同时安全保障控制补偿项可以和任意名义控制器结合，灵活适用各种系统，对系统参数的变化具有良好的抗干扰性，对安全边界的约束具有一定的自适应性。本文分别针对复杂系统中的非零和博弈系统以及互联系统的特性进行安全保障控制器设计。这种保障安全的控制器设计主要分为三个部分。首先设计一种基于障碍函数梯度的安全保障的控制器补偿项。其次根据自适应动态规划理论建立名义控制器，非零和博弈系统中需要满足多个智能体非零和博弈下的纳什均衡，而互联系统中则需要利用分布式稳定性理论设计分布式稳定控制器。最后利用并行学习的更新律对控制器逼近的神经网络进行迭代，借助单一评判网络方法，在得到适用性广泛的安全保障控制器的同时，减少了神经网络逼近参数迭代过程中一半的计算量。 在此基础上，本文借助李雅普诺夫稳定性理论分别证明了非零和博弈与互联系统在安全保障控制器作用下的稳定性，并且证明得到并行学习更新律的参数最终一致有界。本文通过数值仿真实验对互联系统以及非零和博弈的理论分析结果进行验证，表明在所设计的基于障碍函数的安全保障控制器的作用下，复杂系统能够在非凸性以及凸性安全约束下保障状态变量的安全。 为了进一步验证基于障碍函数的安全保障策略在实际应用场景下的效果，本文设计了无人机的硬件模拟实验对安全保障策略进行验证，表明在所设计的安全策略作用下，无人机复杂系统能够在避开固定障碍物以及无人机互相避让控制下保障安全。},

  abstract = {Real-world applications of nonlinear systems tracking control are always challenging due to the existence of uncertainties and disturbances. To design a robust optimal tracking controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with disturbances and actuator saturation, this paper investigates the prescribed performance robust optimal tracking control problem. A prescribed performance mechanism is constructed to convert the dynamics of tracking error into transformed error dynamics, which keeps the system’s operating states within specific bounds, ensuring tracking with predefined error constraints. For the optimal tracking controller design, an optimal index is established to optimize the performance of tracking control, and a robust optimal index is established to optimize the disturbance effect on the tracking error. To achieve robust optimal tracking control that minimizes both optimal and robust optimal indexes, a Stackelberg game is constructed, which provides a hierarchical game structure for the optimal controller and the worst disturbance. The robust optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. An actor-critic-identifier algorithm is designed to approximate the optimal value function, optimal controller, and drifted system parameters. Lyapunov theory is utilized to analyze the closed-loop system’s stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimal control method, two numerical simulations and a hardware experiment on a quadcopter system are conducted. The experiment results demonstrate that our method successfully achieves prescribed performance tracking control when actuators are saturated and disturbances are present.},

  abstract = {Cooperation between unmanned autonomous systems has attracted increasing attention in recent years, particularly the challenging problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) docking in complex environments with dynamic vehicle interactions. This paper proposes a novel finite-time reinforcement learning control scheme for UAV–UGV docking based on a pursuit-evasion game framework. A pursuit-evasion game formulation is developed where the evader vehicle navigates through complex environments while being pursued by a pursuer vehicle required to track and dock with it. The docking performance is optimized through achieving Nash equilibrium of the pursuit-evasion game. The proposed finite-time reinforcement learning algorithm transforms the value function to finite-time space and employs Actor-Critic neural networks to approximate the value function and optimal controller. A finite-time concurrent learning law is utilized to update the neural network weights, ensuring both the pursuit-evasion game equilibrium and learning process converge within finite time. Lyapunov stability analysis proves the finite-time convergence properties of the algorithm. Experimental validation on an aerial-ground vehicle system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving optimal pursuit-evasion performance while maintaining safe landing capability.},
