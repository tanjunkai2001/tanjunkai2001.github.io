	abstract = {Real-world applications of nonlinear systems tracking control are always challenging due to the existence of uncertainties and disturbances. To design a robust optimal tracking controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with disturbances and actuator saturation, this paper investigates the prescribed performance robust optimal tracking control problem. A prescribed performance mechanism is constructed to convert the dynamics of tracking error into transformed error dynamics, which keeps the system’s operating states within specific bounds, ensuring tracking with predefined error constraints. For the optimal tracking controller design, an optimal index is established to optimize the performance of tracking control, and a robust optimal index is established to optimize the disturbance effect on the tracking error. To achieve robust optimal tracking control that minimizes both optimal and robust optimal indexes, a Stackelberg game is constructed, which provides a hierarchical game structure for the optimal controller and the worst disturbance. The robust optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. An actor-critic-identifier algorithm is designed to approximate the optimal value function, optimal controller, and drifted system parameters. Lyapunov theory is utilized to analyze the closed-loop system’s stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimal control method, two numerical simulations and a hardware experiment on a quadcopter system are conducted. The experiment results demonstrate that our method successfully achieves prescribed performance tracking control when actuators are saturated and disturbances are present.},

An original shared control mechanism is established to allocate the relationship between optimal and human control inputs. The model of the system is learned from human maneuver data via the Koopman operator approach, and the optimal controller is approximated online using reinforcement learning techniques. The Lyapunov theory analyzes the stability of the proposed method.

In this digital twin architecture, the real agent acquires an optimal control strategy through observed actions, while the {AI} virtual agent mirrors the real agent to establish a digital replica system and corresponding control policy. Both the real and virtual optimal controllers are approximated using reinforcement learning ({RL}) techniques. Specifically, critic neural networks ({NNs}) are employed to learn the virtual and real optimal value functions, while actor {NNs} are trained to derive their respective optimal controllers. A novel shared mechanism is introduced to integrate both virtual and real value functions into a unified learning framework, yielding an optimal shared controller. This controller adaptively adjusts the confidence ratio between virtual and real agents, enhancing the system’s efficiency and flexibility in handling complex control tasks. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed {AI}–human interactive system is validated through two numerical examples: a representative nonlinear system and an unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) control system.},

For the collaboration of humans and machines, it is crucial to ensure the safety of the interactive process due to the involvement of human beings. First, a barrier-function-based state transformation is developed to ensure full state safety constraints. A level-k{\textbackslash} k {\textbackslash} thinking framework is exploited to obtain bounded rationality. Every single level-k{\textbackslash} k {\textbackslash} control policy is approximated by using adaptive dynamic programming. Inspired by the theory of human behavior modeling, a probabilistic distribution based on Softmax is utilized to model human behavior, which imitates the uncertainty of human intelligence in the cooperative game. Through the construction of a shared control framework, the control inputs of humans and machines are blended to achieve stabilization safely and efficiently. Finally, simulations are implemented to test the effectiveness of the proposed cooperation architecture. The result demonstrates that full-state asymmetric constraints and stabilization are guaranteed in commonly safety-critical situations, and the shared control framework ensures the safety of the overall system when one of the participants is not safety-aware.},
