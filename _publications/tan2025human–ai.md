This paper presents an optimized shared control algorithm for human–AI interaction, implemented through a digital twin framework where the physical system and human operator act as the real agent while an AIdriven digital system functions as the virtual agent. In this digital twin architecture, the real agent acquires an optimal control strategy through observed actions, while the AI virtual agent mirrors the real agent to establish a digital replica system and corresponding control policy. Both the real and virtual optimal controllers are approximated using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Specifically, critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to learn the virtual and real optimal value functions, while actor NNs are trained to derive their respective optimal controllers. A novel shared mechanism is introduced to integrate both virtual and real value functions into a unified learning framework, yielding an optimal shared controller. This controller adaptively adjusts the confidence ratio between virtual and real agents, enhancing the system’s efficiency and flexibility in handling complex control tasks. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed AI–human interactive system is validated through two numerical examples: a representative nonlinear system and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system.
